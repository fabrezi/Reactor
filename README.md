A Single Page Application blueprint for e-commerce sites in ReactJS.

Front-end development is `HARD`. It is a difficult skill. I follow the philosophy of simple-direct usability. The front-end should be simple enough that anyone is able to use it. Further it should be directed towards the application or the service that is provided. 

This repo, main function, is to serve as the blueprint for E-commerce site.

These are the neccessary components of any E-commerce site:

1. User registration (user can use google-email or other token to sign up).
2. Menu of items to make selection.
3. A cart functionality.
4. Payment service (integrated with Stripe, plaids and such).
5. Generate a `feedback` message or a thank-you message.

In essence, an E-commerce site is to simulate a shopping experience through a web portal.
